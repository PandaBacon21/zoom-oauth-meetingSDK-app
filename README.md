This is a sample app using Zoom's OAuth and Meeting SDK app types. 

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to allow users to sign up for your service, and then allow them to authorize this App to leverage Zoom's API on your behalf. 
You will then be able to schedule and create Zoom meetings through the app. 

Once complete, I will then begin working to include the meetingSDK so that you can actually launch and conduct your meetings from within the browser rather than redirecting to the Zoom client.
